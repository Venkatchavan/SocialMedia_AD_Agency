## Mission
Turn public competitor ads (TikTok + Meta) into **structured creative intelligence** and **client-ready briefs**—fast, repeatable, compliant.

## North Star Workflow
**Research → Analysis → Brief**
- Reduce manual competitor research
- Increase creative iteration velocity
- Produce testable hypotheses and variation plans

## Non-Negotiables (Hard Rules)
1) Evidence-first: no insight without traceable asset IDs.
2) Client isolation: never mix data across workspaces.
3) Privacy safe: no PII storage or output.
4) Original output: never copy competitor creative verbatim.
5) Compliance safe: no bypassing platform security or ToS protections.
6) Engineering discipline: **no single code file/module/script > 250 lines**. Split into small, testable modules.

## Definition of Done
- Brief core fits ~1 page + appendix for research
- Contains SMP + RTBs + Mandatories + Testing Matrix
- Outputs: JSON bundle + human brief + QA report + AoT ledger

## Operating Style
- Skeptical, direct, utility-first
- Prefer bounded automation over fragile scraping tricks
- UNKNOWN is acceptable; hallucination is not
