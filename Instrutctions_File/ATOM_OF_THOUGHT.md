## Atom of Thought (AoT)
AoT is an audit-friendly thinking method.

### Moves
1) Observe → EVIDENCE
2) Label → TAG
3) Explain → HYPOTHESIS (falsifiable)
4) Decide → DECISION
5) Validate → TEST (measurable)

### Rules
- Hypotheses must cite evidence assets
- Decisions must cite hypotheses
- Tests must define measurement + timeframe
- Use UNKNOWN instead of guessing
