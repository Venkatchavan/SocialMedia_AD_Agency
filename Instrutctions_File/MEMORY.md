# MEMORY.md

## Long-Term Memory
Store reusable learnings only:
- winning hook patterns by category
- offer patterns by funnel stage
- QA violation patterns + fixes
- prompt versions and benchmark results

## Do NOT Store
- raw comments
- personal identifiers
- private client data outside workspace
- raw media (unless policy allows)

## Recursive Learning Loop (Weekly)
1) Measure: velocity + QA issues + client edits + performance feedback (if available)
2) Diagnose: top 10 wins vs top 10 fails
3) Update: one change only (prompt OR taxonomy OR collection)
4) Validate: regression on fixed benchmark set
5) Version + log + rollback plan
